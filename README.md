# Faculty-web-application-project

This is a project I've developed during my college studies for the course "Web Application Development", which was a direct continuation of the "Basics of Web Technologies" course.

The project consists of a RESTful service and a web application that interact with a SQLite database and fetch movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

## Project overview

The application consists of:

- Backend: Built with JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript
- Frontend: Developed using Angular framework with SCSS for styling

## Key features

- REST API service for database access
- User authentication with two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- Integration with external TMDB (The Movie Database) API
- User management with different role permissions

## Tehnical implementation

- TypeScript for both backend and frontend
- SQLite database for data storage
- JWT for secure API communication
- Angular Material components
- reCAPTCHA v3 integration for forms
- Responsive design with SCSS

This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack web development, implementing modern web technologies, and creating secure user authentication systems.
